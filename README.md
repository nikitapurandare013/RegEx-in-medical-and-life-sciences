# RegEx-in-medical-and-life-sciences<br>
Regular expressions are a powerful tool for searching and analyzing patterns in text data. In Python, the regular expression library, `re`, is a built-in module that can be used for pattern matching in strings. The `re` library offers a variety of functions for working with regular expressions.<br>

Genome sequencing involves determining an organism's complete DNA sequence. Pythonâ€™s re library is used to search for specific patterns, such as repeating motifs or modifications like methylation, within genomic sequences. It also helps identify coding and non-coding regions in the DNA.<br>

In this we will write RegEx for following:-<br>
1. Finding Motifs in Genome Sequences
2. Finding Transcription Factor Binding Sites (TFBSs)
3. Finding Open Reading Frames (ORFs)
4. Identifying Restriction Enzyme Recognition Sites
5. Identifying Protein Motifs
6. Identifying Protein Domains
7. Identifying MicroRNA Target Sites
8. Identifying RNA Secondary Structure
9. Identifying Conserved Protein Motifs
